## Description

Social networking sites such as Facebook have become ubiquitous platforms for communication. A social network is a means of keeping track of a set of people and the relationships between them.

For this project, we are going to write a simple social networking application called **Social Magnet**.

In Social Magnet, a member has a wall containing his personal information, and the last few messages to the wall. 

All members are automatically players of an integrated farming game called **City Farmers**. In the game, the farmer (i.e. the player) manages a virtual farm by planting, growing and harvesting virtual crops.
