## Description

Social networking sites such as Facebook have become ubiquitous platforms for communication. A social network is a means of keeping track of a set of people and the relationships between them.

For this project, we are going to write a simple social networking application called **Social Magnet**.

In Social Magnet, a member has a wall containing his personal information, and the last few messages to the wall.

All members are automatically players of an integrated farming game called **City Farmers**. In the game, the farmer (i.e. the player) manages a virtual farm by planting, growing and harvesting virtual crops.

## Usage

Confidential database credentials should be stored in the `scripts/env.bat` or `scripts/env.sh` file. See [`env-sample.bat`](scripts/env-sample.bat) or [`env-sample.sh`](scripts/env-sample.sh).

#### Compilation

Use `compile.bat` or `compile.sh` to compile the application.

#### Running

Use `run.bat` or `run.sh` to run the application, after setting the database credentials.

#### Testing
