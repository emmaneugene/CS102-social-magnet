# CS102 Final Project

Social Magnet, City Farmers

## Functional Requirements

Social networking sites such as Facebook have become ubiquitous platforms for communication. A social network is a means of keeping track of a set of people and the relationships between them.

For this project, we are going to write a simple social networking application called **Social Magnet**.

In Social Magnet, a member has a wall containing his personal information, and the last few messages to the wall. 

All members are automatically players of an integrated farming game called **City Farmers**. In the game, the farmer (i.e. the player) manages a virtual farm by planting, growing and harvesting virtual crops.

> **Note**: You are expected to perform input validation, and show an appropriate error message if the user enters an invalid option.

## Entities

### Social Magnet

The social network that you are building.

A person has to register as a member of Social Magnet in order to participate in the network.

Each member has a wall and shares posts with his friends.

In the Social Magnet network, relationships are **reciprocal** (i.e. bi-directional). 

* If Alice is a friend of Bob, Bob is a friend of Alice as well.

#### My Wall

A member's wall displays:

* 5 **most-recent** posts
* Full name
* Rank (e.g. novice)
* Wealth ranking among his friends.
  * This is the amount of gold the member has amassed in the City Farmers game.

Your recent posts will not be visible to non-friend members. However, your full name, rank and wealth ranking will be visible to everyone.

The owner or his friends can post to the wall.

Each post on "My Wall" shows the number of likes and dislikes.

```

```

#### Post

A post provides a member with an outlet to share every aspect of his life with his friends.

A member can either post on his own wall or a friend's wall.

When posting, a member can tag his friend(s) in his post so that this message appears on multiple walls, using the `@` sign. For example, if a member posts the following message on his wall:

```
Until now, @evelyn, @adeline, @marilyn's laptops have bitten the
dust. See, OOP is tough on laptops as well :/
```

The following post will automatically appear on the wall of the member who made this post, as well as the walls of `evelyn`, `adeline` and `marilyn`.

```
Until now, evelyn, adeline, marilyn's laptops have bitten the dust. 
See, OOP is tough on laptops as well :/
```

In the event that an invalid username is tagged, then the text will appear as it is (with the `@` sign).

For example, if `ninjaturtle` is not a valid username, the following message will be rendered as it is:

```
@ninjaturtle is mutable
```

* All valid user tags will be rendered without `@`, and all invalid user tags will be rendered with the `@` sign.

When a post is removed, the associated information (who likes and dislikes) and the replies are deleted permanently.

Tagging will work only for the original post. **A member cannot tag other members in replies.**

For a post in which multiple friends are tagged, it should appear on the wall of all friends who are tagged.

* A reply from any wall will be visible for everyone who sees the posts (either from the **News Feed** or **My Wall**).
* Anyone tagged in the post can remove the post and the associated replies.

Deleting a post (using the **kill** functionality) will only affect the user's wall.

* If person A tags person B in a post to his own wall, when person B deletes the post from his wall (i.e. person B's wall), he will only delete it from his own.

When a post is deleted, all the associated replies are deleted too.

### City Farmer

This is the game that is made available to all members of Social Magnet.

#### Farmer

In the City Farmer game, a member is a farmer.

At the start, a farmer will be given 50 gold.

A farmer has rank.

* Rank is an indication of his seniority in the game, and is based on the experience points that he has gained through farming.
* As the farmer gets promoted in rank, he will unlock more plot of land for farming.

#### Land

Each farmer has his own plot(s) of land.

The farmer will use a bag of **seeds** to plant his **crop** on a plot of land.

* The farmer buys the bags of seeds from **My Seed Store**.
* The farmer may only plant one type of seed at any one time on a plot of land.

#### Crop

For each plot of land, only 1 crop can be planted at a time.

Each crop will grow to maturity in a fixed interval, T (in minutes).

The farmer is given another T minutes to harvest the crop, after which the crop wilt.

For example, if the current time is 1pm, (assuming that the T value for papaya is 30 minutes):

* The plot of land planted with a papaya seed will mature at 1:30pm.
* The farmer has to harvest it between 1:30pm and 2pm.
* After 2pm, the crop will wilt.

When the crop has wilt, the farmer will have to pay 5 gold to clear the plot.

* The farmer can only plant seeds on a cleared plot.

A bag of seeds planted on a plot of land will generate different yield (i.e. different number of units of produce).

Each unit of produce will generate a fixed number of experience points (XP), which may differ for different produce types. 

* For example, one bag of papaya seeds produces 10 units of papaya, and each papaya generates 5 XP.
  * The total XP gained by the player will be 50 XP (10 X 5).

The formula to calculate the total number of units produced: 

$$
\text{# units} \sim U(\mathrm{yield_{min}},\mathrm{yield_{max}})
$$

#### Visit Friend

In the City Farmer game, a farmer can visit a friend's farmland.

During the visit, he can **steal** a small quantity (up to 5% inclusive) of his friend's produce (if they are not harvested yet).

* For each plot of land, generate a random number(between 1 and 5) to determine the amount available for theft.

The total amount of produce available that all your friends (the total) can steal from you is 20% of your produce.

In the event that the remaining quantity available for theft is lesser than the random number generated, use the smaller of the two values.

## Data Files

The following data files will be provided:

* `rank.csv`
* `crop.csv`

## Database Guidelines

Only MySQL is allowed (no MS Access, MS SQL Server, Oracle etc).

Initialize the relevant tables with data from the CSV files.

Prepare a human-readable script called `deploy.sql` and place it in the `sql` directory of your submission.

* `deploy.sql` should contain your `CREATE` and `INSERT` SQL commands to create the necessary database and tables which your application uses.
* The instructor will run the script on their laptops during assessment using this command...

```bash
$ mysql -u root -p < deploy.sql
```

...so do ensure that this script works.

Include the necessary JDBC driver(s) in the lib directory of your submission.

Include instructions in a `README.txt` file in the `sql` directory on what other configuration files should be changed in order for your application to work with the database.

* You will be **penalized** if unclear or incorrect instructions provided results in your database not being set up properly on the instructorsâ€™ laptop, or your application not being able to connect to the database correctly. 

The database name should be `magnet`. A sample `deploy.sql` is shown below:

```mysql
-- drop database if exists and recreate it
drop database if exists magnet;
create database magnet;

-- use this database to create and populate the tables
use magnet;

-- create commands (this is just an example)
CREATE TABLE contact (
    contact_id  INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    given_name  VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    family_name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    email       VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(contact_id)
);

-- insert commands (needed for your application to work)
INSERT INTO contact (contact_id, given_name, family_name, email)
VALUES
(1, 'Dukester', 'Lee', 'geek@smu.edu.sg');
```
